# Example Audio

This example is based on a copy of the cores/getting_started/ example. It
demonstrates how to load a PCM audio file using the OSD, transfer it
to the FPGA then play back through the Replay Audio DAC.

This is just what the "loader" core does, however, I found it useful to
recreate this part of the loader from a more basic starting state as
a way to better understand how the replay framework fits together.

A guide is available at:
    
    https://www.mups.co.uk/guide/fpga-replay-audio-example/

Which runs through the steps needed to go from the "getting-started"
source to this final version.
